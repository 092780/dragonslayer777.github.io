Hello everyone!
Today I'll talk about 10 anime, I watched, which were released in 2016. There are **movies**, **TV series** and **OVA** here. Also the respective sections are divided into ***new*** (fresh watch/first season) and ***sequel/prequel*** (needs to be watched in respective order). So let's get started.

## Movies

### New

**Kimi no Na wa [Your Name]**

This is one the most beautiful movies I've ever watched. The animation and art is just beautiful. The scene where the meteorite splits in two in the sky is absolutely breathtaking. The concept of two people switching soul in the movie is not exactly the first in fantasy storytelling, but the way it has been executed is very fresh. The story leaves you craving more but also with somewhat peace of mind. The music is mesmerizing. I really loved the songs. All together this romantic, supernatural movie is a ***must watch*** according to me.

### Sequel/Prequel

**Kizumonogatari : Tekketsu-Hen/Nekketsu-Hen**

The much awaited movie for me. After watching mostly shounen anime I was looking for some mature genre. You know something veterans would watch. Then I discovered the [Monogatari Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogatari_(series)) and I've never looked back. It was perfect! The wordplay, The analysis of a characters, The references to **Evangelion** (*"I will protect you"* -Rei) and so many other anime, the different but amazing art style, limbs tearing, blood showering (literally), suspense music, everything was perfect. The complexity of conversation in this anime could match with my own twisted way of thinking and interacting! So Kizumonogatari is the latest volume from the series and it is being released in a 3 part movie. The first(**tekketsu**) and second(**nekketsu**) part has been released in 2016 while the third and last(**reiketsu**) part premieres on 2017. This movie is best watched after finishing the rest of the series as it takes a little getting-used-to to the different art style of the series. The order I watched and recommend is following:

+ Bakemonogatari
+ Nisemonogatari
+ Nekomonogatari:Kuro
+ Monogatari Series Second Season
+ Hanamonogatari
+ Tsukimonogatari
+ Owarimonogatari (I)
+ Koyomimonogatari
+ Kizumonogatari

More information on the series order or the series in general can be found in the [monogatari subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/araragi/comments/253p64/the_orders_to_monogatari_condensed_version)

## TV Series

### New

**Boku Dake ga Inai Machi [Erased]**

![cover_erased](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/11/76932.jpg)

I noticed the popularity of Erased when it released. Since it scored pretty high on [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi) I thought I'd save up the series for a later watch. But when I heard some ***HUGE*** spoiler, I just got heartbroken. I thought I should just get over with it. But the end results were pretty different from what I had expected. The series has average visuals, nothing too fancy. But the story is good. A 29 year old manga artist has a certain power to prevent bad things from happening around himself. But things roll quickly once his mother gets murdered. He has to remeber the memories he once forgotten. However unlike many I would say Erased was not pointed towards being a romantic love story. So watch it for the plot.


**Boku no Hero Academia [My Hero Academia]**

![cover_myheroac](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/10/78745.jpg)

Watched One Punch Man? Want something similarly action packed and in a similar setting? Look no more. Boku no Hero Academia was one of the most enjoyable and fun series for me! It's art style is more comic but reminds me of OPM. The animation is very good. Heroes are born with Quirks. Our main character does not have any quirk *(heh.. talk about stereotype)*. Can he become a hero? After he meets the legendary hero All Might, his life changes forever. I don't think there are many who have not already watched this show and if you have not then you should watch right now. It's very newcomer friendly.


**Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu**

![cover_rezero](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/11/79410.jpg)

This one is one of my latest watches. I love ***stuck-in-the-MMORPG-have-to-lead-a-life-there*** kind of anime. *Log Horizon* is one of my favorites. This one started good enough, though I had some trouble understanding how he entered the game. Anyway, things got very serious very fast! I couldn't even get comfortable with the characters yet and there was blood splattering all over in first episode. But after that it became a little predictable (Hint: *Steins;Gate*). But after reaching mid season things changed drasticly. I started getting pissed on the main character. My frustration level was like I was watching Shinji Ikari (*Evangelion*) all over again! But **Rem** took away all my worries! The series is very well written and the psychlogical impact of this is undeniable. It is definitely worth a watch if you've not got caught up in the very notable Re:Zero hype and watched it already!


**Koutetsujou no Kabaneri [Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress]**

![cover_kabaneri](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/12/79164.jpg)

When I watched the promo of *Kabaneri* I was like *"This is just a **Shingeki no Kyoujin** ripoff"*. But *SNK* is such a robust anime, I thought I'd give *Kabaneri* a try. I was not disappointed. Before everything I just want to say this much, you make 10 ripoff of *SNK* I'll watch 10 of them. I love the mystery and thrill of *SNK* that much. Even though *Kabaneri* had too many similar elements to *SNK* there were some unique elements too. Like the visuals! I have to give it to *Kabaneri*, though produced by the same animation studio *Kabaneri* offers a more vivid color pallete than *SNK*. Where *SNK* was made darker, *Kabaneri* somewhat gives off more of a hopeful vibe. The original soundtrack is just mind blowing. I mean if I have to give **best soundtrack** in my this list, it'll definitely be *Kabaneri*. People often complain about the **second half of the series**, though I found it perfectly fine as human insecuity, greed, hatred, passion have more direct influence on the point of view of the storytelling, like how Ikoma asked princess *"whom are you going to point the gun at?"*. *Kabaneri* is not just about humanity surviving against the **Kabane** (*Zombies with heart of steel*), but it is also about human distrust and the paranoia how someone can get affected very eaily, which was not the case in *SNK*, so far at least.

### Sequel/Prequel

**Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara [Food Wars! The Second Plate]**
